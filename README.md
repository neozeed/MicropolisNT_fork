# MicropolisNT

A port of the classic Micropolis (SimCity) game to Windows NT using GDI graphics.
This is so you can play SimCity on your NT RISC machine like Alpha AXP, MIPS, PPC and ARM.

This game was originally developed by Will Wright and Maxis. Later by DUX Software for Unix and finally released as open source by Don Hopkins.
